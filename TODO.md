# TODO

## index.html

* Correctly size images and font further to be responsive.
* Implement GGG counter.
* Change 'GGG Discovered This Year' format discovery info to match the rest of the site.

## about.html
* Work on what information to display and how to display it in about.html.

## class-x-search.html

* Fix 'lead-desc' div to change width when device screen shrinks.
* Scale font and images accordingly.
* Create lower resolution pictures for .picture-card image so they can load faster (Currently 1920 x 1080 then CSS modifies dimensions)
* Align 'K10-Type Anomaly' ::after vertically with the planet name, and maybe prevent shifting the name over because of its presence.

## ggg#.html

* Make lead picture lower resolution, as well as shift 'discovery information' to the side to use whitespace on sides, maybe description too.
* Finish the 'Orbital Characteristics (Info)' tab to change information in the module on-click.
* Learn how to generate picture and pin on the galaxy map from system coordinates (?)
* Make gallery pictures (as well as lead picture) pop out for max resolution on-click.
