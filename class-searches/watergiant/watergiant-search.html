                <p>There is only one known Green Water Giant, yet is probably the most significant. This discovery was proof that not just the 'proper' (hydrogen & helium based) 
                    gas giants were capable of generating a green variant. As Water Giants share their colors and cloud patterns with Gas Giants with Water-Based Life, their green variants
                    also show some similarity with them as well. There is a white-tan color found on normal Water Giants near the poles, but going towards the equatorial regions, the base color
                    switches to a dark red red-purple color. There are many equatorial green streaks encircling the planet and, in contrast with the bright white-blue color of the planet's large
                    ring system, this planet is a must-see for anyone travelling in the Ryker's Hope Region.</p>
